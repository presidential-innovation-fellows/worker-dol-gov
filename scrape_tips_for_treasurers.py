This script scrapes <www.fec.gov>'s Tips for Treasurers content and outputs a
JSON array containing one object literal per individual tip.

Steps:

#.  From a starting URL, follows appropriate links to find more links to pages
    containing tips.
#.  Given a list of pages containing tips:

    #.  Parses HTML from those pages to find tip content.
    #.  Alters the content of ``a`` element ``href`` attributes to turn
        relative URLs into fully-qualified URLs.
        Also removes known broken URLs and replaces them with working ones.
    #.  Can optionally check URLs in order to build a list of broken ones.
    #.  Extracts tip dates, titles, URLs, and content from the parsed HTML.
    #.  Creates ``Tip`` objects from that data.
    #.  Returns a list of ``Tip`` objects.
#.  Serializes the list of ``Tip`` objects to JSON.
    Optionally also seriliazes the list of broken URLs to JSON.
