### What this means for you

Employers are not allowed to discriminate against you because of:

- your race
- your color or skin tone
- your hair texture
- stereotypes or assumptions about your abilities, traits, or the performance based on your race
- marriage or association with an individual of a difference race
- membership or association with ethnic based organizations or groups
- attendance or participation in schools or places of worship generally associated with certain minority groups
- cultural practices or characteristics often linked to race or ethnicity, such as cultural dress or manner of speech
- medical conditions that predominantly affect one race

Discrimination on the basis of an immutable characteristic associated with race—such as skin color, hair texture, or certain facial features—violates the law, even though not all members of the race share the same characteristic.

Even though race and color overlap, they are not synonymous. Color discrimination can occur between people of different races or ethnicities, or between people of the same race or ethnicity.

### Examples of discrimination

In general, this means that you cannot be:

- fired
- rejected for a job or promotion
- given lesser assignments
- forced to take leave

because of your race or color.
