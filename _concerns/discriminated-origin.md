Employers are not allowed to discriminate against you because of:

- your ethnicity
- an accent
- marriage or association with a person of a certain national origin

Discrimination can occur when the victim and the person who discriminated against them are the same national origin.

### Examples of discrimination

In general, this means that you cannot be:

- fired
- rejected for a job or promotion
- given lesser assignments
- forced to take leave

because of your national origin.
