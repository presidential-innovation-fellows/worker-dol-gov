Employers are not allowed to discriminate against you based on the fact that you:

- have a physical or mental disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities
- have a record of having a disability
- are regarded as having a disability

### Examples of discrimination

In general, this means that you cannot be:

- fired
- rejected for a job or promotion
- given lesser assignments
- forced to take leave

because of a disability.
