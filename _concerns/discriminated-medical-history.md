Employers are not allowed to discriminate against you because of:

- your family medical history
- information from your genetic tests or a family memberâ€™s genetic tests
- information you received using reproductive technology

An employer may never use genetic information to make an employment decision because genetic information is not relevant to your current ability to work.

### Examples of discrimination

In general, this means that you cannot be:

- fired
- rejected for a job or promotion
- given lesser assignments
- forced to take leave

because of your family medical history or genome.
