### What this means for you

Petty slights, annoyances, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not rise to the level of illegality. To be unlawful, the conduct must create a work environment that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to reasonable people.

Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or putdowns, offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances, including:

- the harasser can be the victim’s supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the employer, a coworker, or a non-employee
- the victim does not have to be the person harassed, but can be anyone affected by the offensive conduct
- unlawful harassment may occur without economic injury to, or discharge of, the victim
