statement: You have the right to be paid fairly.
---
You have the right to be paid at least the federal minimum wage ($7.25) for all hours worked regardless of whether you are paid by the hour, the day, or at a piece rate. Some state laws provide greater employee protections; employers must comply with both.

Tipped employees may be paid $2.13 per hour. If your tips combined with cash wages do not equal the minimum wage, your employer must make up the difference.

You have the right to be paid for all hours you work in a work week. In general, “hours worked” includes all time an employee must be on duty, or at the place of work. Normally, time spent in training, traveling from site to site during the day, and doing repair work must be paid.

You have the right to receive overtime pay, or 1.5 times your regular rate of pay after 40 hours of work in a 7-day workweek.
