## You have the right to be treated equally.

An employer cannot refuse to hire you, or fire you, because of your citizenship, immigration status, or national origin.

Discrimination can include requests for specific or extra documents to show you are allowed to work in the U.S. or to complete the [Form I-9](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9). For example, if you present your state-issued driverâ€™s license and unrestricted Social Security card, an employer cannot require you to produce your work permit or Permanent Resident Card.

Employers cannot retaliate against or intimidate workers who complain of this type of discrimination. If an employer discriminates against you in one of these ways, you may be rehired, allowed to keep working, or get paid for time when you should have been allowed to work.
