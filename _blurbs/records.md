## You have the right to accurate record keeping.

Records must be kept of all wages paid and of all hours worked, regardless of where the work is performed. You should keep a record of your employer’s name, address, phone number and the hours you worked.

We have a [timesheet app you can use with your iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dol-timesheet/id433638193?mt=8) to track hours, and a [printable work hours calendar in English](https://www.dol.gov/whd/FLSAEmployeeCard/calendarR5Web.pdf) and [Spanish](https://www.dol.gov/whd/FLSAEmployeeCard/spanCalR5Web.pdf) to track your rate of pay, start and stop times, and arrival and departure times.
