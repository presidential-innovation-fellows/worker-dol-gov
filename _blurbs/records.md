statement: You have the right to accurate record keeping.
---
Records must be kept of all wages paid and of all hours worked, regardless of where the work is performed. You should keep a record of your employerâ€™s name, address, phone number and the hours you worked.

We have a [timesheet app you can use with your iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dol-timesheet/id433638193?mt=8) to track hours, and a [printable work hours calendar in English](https://www.dol.gov/whd/FLSAEmployeeCard/calendarR5Web.pdf) and [Spanish](https://www.dol.gov/whd/FLSAEmployeeCard/spanCalR5Web.pdf) to track your rate of pay, start and stop times, and arrival and departure times.
