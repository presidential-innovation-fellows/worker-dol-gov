## You have the right to be protected from retaliation.

An employer cannot retaliate by taking _adverse action_ against workers who report injuries, safety concerns, or other protected activities. You should not be discriminated for exercising your rights, including your right to:

- file an OSHA complaint
- participate in an inspection or talking to an inspector
- seek access to employer exposure and injury records
- report an injury
- request an OSHA inspection, and speak to the inspector
- raise a safety or health complaint with the employer

If you have been retaliated or discriminated against for exercising your rights, you must file a complaint with OSHA within 30 days of the alleged adverse action.
