## Children have rights.

Federal child labor law generally prohibits the employment of minors under the age of 14, restricts the hours of work for minors under 16, and prohibits the employment of minors under the age of 18 in any hazardous occupation. 16 years old is the minimum age to perform garment production.

Detailed information on federal and state child labor laws is available on [YouthRules!](https://www.youthrules.gov/).
