statement: You have the right to take unpaid leave.
---
You have the right to (eligible employees of covered employers) take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.

If you are eligible, you have 12 workweeks of leave in a 12-month period:

- for the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth
- for adoption or foster care placement and to care for the newly placed child within one year of placement
- to care for your spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition
- for a serious health condition that keeps you from performing the essential functions of your job
- any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that your spouse, child, or parent is a covered military member on “covered active duty”

If you are a covered servicemember, you have 26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for your spouse, child, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave) if they have a serious injury or illness.
