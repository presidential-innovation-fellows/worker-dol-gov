You have the right to be treated equally by an employer that is a federal contractor or subcontractor regardless of your race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran. 
 
Federal contractors and subcontractors may not discriminate against you because you have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed your compensation or that of others, subject to certain limitations.

You have the right to complain about discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, and participate in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit with being retaliated against.
