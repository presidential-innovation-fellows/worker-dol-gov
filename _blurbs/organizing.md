You have the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization for collective bargaining purposes or working together without a union to improve terms and conditions of employment.

You have a right to participate or not participate in any of these activities. You have a right to not be restrained or coerced by employers or labor organizations in exercising these rights.

Federal law protects your right to act together with other employees to address conditions at work, with or without a union. This protection extends to certain work-related conversations conducted on social media, such as Facebook and Twitter.
