statement: You have the right to be treated equally.
---
You have a right to be treated equally regardless of a disability if you are qualified for a job in the private sector (if the employer has 15 or more employees) or state, local, and federal governments. You have a right to complain about discrimination, file a charge of discrimination, and participate in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.

You have a right to reasonable accommodations for any known physical or mental limitations resulting from a disability if you are otherwise qualified, unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the operation of the employerâ€™s business.
