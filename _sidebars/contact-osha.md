## Learn about filing a complaint

Please note that it is illegal for your employer to fire, demote, harass, or otherwise retaliate against you for reporting an issue to OSHA. If you believe your working conditions are unsafe or unhealthful, you may file a confidential complaint with OSHA and ask for an inspection. If possible, bring the conditions to your employerâ€™s attention.
