Please call the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) at 1-800-397-6251.

All services are free and confidential. We will not disclose any information to your employer unless you decide to file a formal complaint.

## Learn about filing a complaint

Weâ€™ll help you decide what to do next, and conduct an investigation if you decide to file a formal complaint. Most complaints need to be filed within 180 days of the alleged discrimination, so it is best to begin the process early. If your complaint relates to your disability or veteran status, it must be filed within 300 days (unless the time for filing is extended for good cause).

Please note that it is illegal for your employer to fire, demote, harass, or otherwise retaliate against you for reporting an issue to OFCCP.
