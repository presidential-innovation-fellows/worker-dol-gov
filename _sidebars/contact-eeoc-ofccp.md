All services are free and confidential. We will not disclose any information to your employer unless you decide to file a formal complaint.

## Learn about filing a complaint

We’ll help you decide what to do next, and conduct an investigation if you decide to file a formal complaint. Because you generally need to file a complaint within 180 days of the alleged violation to take further legal action, it is best to begin the process early.

Please note that it is illegal for your employer to fire, demote, harass, or otherwise retaliate against you for reporting an issue to us.
