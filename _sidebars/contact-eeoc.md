Please contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC):

All services are free and confidential. We will not disclose any information to your employer unless you decide to file a formal complaint.

## Learn about filing a complaint

Weâ€™ll help you decide what to do next, and conduct an investigation if you decide to file a formal complaint. Because you must file a complaint within 180 days of the alleged violation to take further legal action (or 300 days if the employer is also covered by a state or local employment discrimination law), it is best to begin the process early.

Please note that it is illegal for your employer to fire, demote, harass, or otherwise retaliate against you for reporting an issue to the EEOC.
